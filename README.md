# About
A calculator app built as a way to familiarize myself with C#, WPF .NET and Visual Studio.

# To do:
- Process negative numbers
- Display commas to separate thousands
- Process valid keyboard strokes
- Figure out a cleaner way of implementation using data binding
- Figure out how to disable certain buttons at a certain state (for example equals button, before the two numbers and operation are entered)
